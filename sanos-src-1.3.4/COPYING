objconv

By Agner Fog. (C) 2011. (http://www.agner.org/optimize/#objconv)

Objconv is an open source program published under the conditions of the GNU General
Public License, as defined in www.gnu.org/licenses/. The program is provided without any
warranty or support.
It may not be legal to modify, convert or disassemble copyright protected software files
without permission from the copyright owner. It is an open question whether it is legal to
modify or convert a copyright protected function library and use it for other purposes than
presupposed in the license conditions. It is recommended to ask the vendor for permission
before developing and publishing any software that is built with the use of a converted
copyright protected function library.
Copyright law does not generally permit disassembly of copyright protected software for the
purpose of modifying the software, for circumventing a copy protection mechanism, for
using part of the code in other contexts, or for extracting the algorithms behind the code.
European, Australian and US copyright law does, however, under certain conditions permit
reverse engineering of copyright protected software when the purpose is to extract the
information necessary for establishing interoperability with other software, and only to the
extent necessary for this purpose. However, I am not a legal expert. The user should seek
legal advise before deciding whether it is legal to use objconv on copyrighted software for a
specific purpose.
